if conditions
loops 
    - for loop
        - iterates
        - sequence data type -> data type that has start and end or ranges()
        - range(start:end:jump/step)
    - while loop
        - iterates object until the condition False/met
        - while takes only boolean data type
        - infinite loop (this is the problem)
        - when we should use while loop?
            - the best use for the while loop is when you don't know the end and condition
