--- What does the for loop do? ---
- Goes through all items in the list or any other object
- Iterates  --->

-> For loops: it has the start and it has the end. It will go through each object in between and execute code block with that object

sequence is the object that has starting point and ending point
"Hello" --> 'H' ..... 'o'

# for <iterable_var> in <sequence>
    # <code>

# for char in "Hello":
