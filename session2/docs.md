- What's a computer program?
    - set of instructions that runs from top to bottom
    - binary code


- What is python?
    - high level programming language
    - interpretted programming language
    - easy to understand (as if you read pseudocode)
    - python has 10K libraries available that extends the functionality

- Difference between compiled and interpretted progamming languages
    - compiled language:
        pros:
            - faster
            - compatible with any computer (same architecture)
            - does not need any additional language/tools installed
        cons:
            - everytime when you make a change, you have to build/compile

    - interpretetd language:
        pros:
            - easier to interract, no build involved
        cons:
            - you need additional tools (python3)
            - slower than compiled language


- what is a variable?

- Data Types?
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Hexidecimal, Octal, Binary

    Operators:
    - ** -- power of
    - % -- modulus or takes the remainder
    - // -- integer division
    - / 

    - Strings

    - Boolean
        - data type that has False and True only
        operators:
            - and = True and False = False
            - or = True or False = True
            - not = Opposite of boolean
